Inspired by the [`request` package](https://github.com/request/request).

## Usage
```js
'use strict';
const https = require('https');
const timer = require('@szmarczak/http-timer');

const request = https.get('https://httpbin.org/anything');
const timings = timer(request);

request.on('response', response => {
	response.on('data', () => {}); 
	response.on('end', () => {
		console.log(timings);
	});
});

```

## API

### timer(request)

Returns: `Object`

- `start` - Time when the request started.
- `socket` - Time when a socket was assigned to the request.
- `lookup` - Time when the DNS lookup finished.
- `connect` - Time when the socket successfully connected.
- `upload` - Time when the request finished uploading.
- `response` - Time when the request fired the `response` event.
- `end` - Time when the response fired the `end` event.
- `error` - Time when the request fired the `error` event.
- `phases`
	- `wait` - `timings.socket - timings.start`
	- `dns` - `timings.lookup - timings.socket`
	- `tcp` - `timings.connect - timings.lookup`
	- `request` - `timings.upload - timings.connect`
	- `firstByte` - `timings.response - timings.upload`
	- `download` - `timings.end - timings.response`
	- `total` - `timings.end - timings.start` or `timings.error - timings.start`

**Note**: The time is a `number` representing the milliseconds elapsed since the UNIX epoch.
